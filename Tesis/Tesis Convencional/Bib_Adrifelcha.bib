	Abstract = {Seven experiments, designed to investigate the effects of various factors on word recognition, are reported. For each experiment the subject memorized a list of from 16 to 54 words and then was tested with a sequence of single words; each test involved weither a target word (member of the list) or distractor word (not on the memorized list). In response to each test word the subject pressed one of two keys, indicating whether the word was a target or a distractor. Response latency was shown to depend upon the number of prior tests on a given word (Experiment 1) and the length of the target list (Experiment 2). Experiment 3 and 6 demonstrated that response latency to a target word can be decreased by repeating the word in the study list or by otherwise making certain words more salient. Experiment 4, 5 and 7 showed that response latency was affected by similarities between target and distractor words and by such word characteristics as frequency, concreteness, and syllable length. The latency and error data were discussed in terms of a moedl for recognition which assumes that the subject either (1) makes an initial fast response based on the familiarity of the test word or (2) if the familiarity is neitger high nor low, delays responding until an extended search of the emorized list is carried out. Quantitative predictions generated by the model compare favorably with the data.},

Thus, trials with a signal presentation consist of a mixture of 2 (or more) latent classes of trials.

For example, mixture SDT offers an alternative to the unequal variance signal detection model; it can also account for nonlinear normal receiver operating characteristic curves, as found in recent research.},

The paper offered formal proofs and computational demosntrations that decisions based on likelihood ratios produce the three regularities. A survey of data ased on group ROCs from 36 studies validated the likelihood ratio assumption by showing that its three implied regularities are ubiquituous. The study noted, however, that bias, another basis factor in Signal Detection Theory, can obscure the Mirror Effect. In this paper we examine how bias affects the regularities at the theoretical leve. The theoretical analysis shows: (1) how bias obscures the Mirror Effect, not the other two reguarities, and (2) four ways to counter that obscuring. We then report the results of five experiments that support the theoretical analysis. The analyses and the experimental results also demonstrate: (1) that the three regularities govern individual, as well as group, performance, (2) alternative explanations of the regularities are ruled oyt, and (3) tat Signal Detection Theory, correctly applied, gives a simple and unified explanation of recognition memory data.},

However, we show that statistics based on products or ratios of right triangle areas, including recently proposed bias index and not-yet-proposed but apparently plausible sensitivity index, are consistent with a decision process based on logistic distributions. Even the Pollack and Norman measure, which is based on non-right triangles, is approximately logistic for low values of sensitivity.

	Abstract = {Although many nonlinear models of cognition have been proposed in the past 50 years, there has been little consideration of corresponding statistical techniques for their analysis. In analyses with nonlinear models, unmodeled variability from the selection of items or participants may lead to asymptotically biased estimation. This asymptotic bias, in turn, renders inference problematic. We show, for example, that a signal detection analysis of recognition memory data leads to asymptotic underestimation of sensitivity. To eliminate asymptotic bias, we advocate hierarchical models in which participant variaility, item bariability and measurement error are modeled simultaneously. By accounting for multiple sources of variability, hierarchical models yield consistent and accurate estimates of participant and item effects in recognition memory. This article is written in tutorial format; we rovide an introduction to Bayesian statistics, hierarchical modeling and Markov chain Monte Carlo computational techniques.},

We describe several of these areas and the advantages that can be realizad through the application of SDT.

Mathematical formulae for the measures are presented, as are methods for calculating the measures with lookup tables, computer software specifically developed for SDT applications, and general purpose computer software (including spreadsheets and statistical analysis software)},

	Abstract = {Presents a sample of empirical relative operating characteristics (ROCs), drawn both from discrimination tasks in experimental psychology and from diagnostic tasks in several practical fields. These illustrative ROCs are seen to be fitted well by a straight line, of varying slope, on a binormal graph. The form of empirical ROCs is consistent with one version of the variable-criterion model provided by signal detection theory and inconsistent both with other versions of that model and with the main threshold models. That form supports the use of certain indices of discrimination accuracy derived from detection theory and substantiates the potential unreliability of others of that heritage and, more importantly, the unreliability of the several accuracy indices in common use that can be shown to imply one or another threshold model. The preferred detection-theory indices of accuracy are ones that accommodate the varying slope of empirical ROCs. These indices are effectively independent of the decision criterion, which can be indexed separately. Measuring both accuracy and the decision criterion appropriately enables the delineation of the dependent variables affected by independent variables in psychological studies and the assessment of the efficacy and accuracy of diagnostic systems.

	Abstract = {A novel experimental paradigm for measuring state paranoia by means of signal detection theory was evaluated. A liberal response bias, indicating the tendency to recognize facial expressions as threatening was expected to reflect paranoia. Against theoretical expectations, heightened paranoia questionnaire scores were associated with a non-liberal bias, which was not affected by negative emotion per se. However, subsequent analyses revealed that, if anxious participants with heightened paranoia adopted a comparatively ore liberal response bias. These findings corroborate the eminent role of anxiety in paranoia and demonstrate that state paranoia can be captured with the present paradigm},

	Abstract = {The juxtaposition of established signal detection theory models of perception and more recent claims about the encoding of uncertainty in perception is a rich source of confusion. Are the latter simpy a rehash of the former? Here, we make ana ttempt to distinguish precisely between optimal and probabilistic computation. In optimal computation, the observer minimizes the expected cost under a posterior probability distribution. In probabilistic computation, the observer uses higher moments of the likelihood functon of the stimulus on a tria-by-trial basis. Computation can be optimal without being probabilistic and vice-versa. Most signal detection theory models describe optimal computation. Behavioral data only provide evidence for a neural representation of uncertaity if they are best described by a model of probabilistic computation. We argue that single-neuron activity sometimes suffices for optimal computation, but never for probabilistic computation. A population code is needed instead. Not every population code is equally suitable, because nusance parameters have to be marginalized out. This problem is solved by Poisson-like, but not by Gaussian bariability. Finally we build a dictionary between signal detection theory quantities and Poisson.like population quantities.},

	Abstract = {Two influential models of recognition memory, the unequal variance signal-detection model and a dual-process threshold/detection model accurately describe the receiver operating characteristic, but only the latter model can provide estimates of recollection and familiarity. Such estimates often accord with those provided by the remember-know procedure, and both methods are now widely used in the neuroscience literature to identify the brain correlates of recollection and familiarity. However, in recent years, a substantial literature has accumulated directly contrasting the signal-detection model against the threshold/Detection-model, and that litrature is almost unanimous in its endorsement of signal detection theory. A dual process version of signal detection theory implies that individual recgnition decisions are not process pure, and it suggest new ways to investigate the brain correlates of recognition memory.},
