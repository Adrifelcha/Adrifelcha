	Abstract = {Seven experiments, designed to investigate the effects of various factors on word recognition, are reported. For each experiment the subject memorized a list of from 16 to 54 words and then was tested with a sequence of single words; each test involved weither a target word (member of the list) or distractor word (not on the memorized list). In response to each test word the subject pressed one of two keys, indicating whether the word was a target or a distractor. Response latency was shown to depend upon the number of prior tests on a given word (Experiment 1) and the length of the target list (Experiment 2). Experiment 3 and 6 demonstrated that response latency to a target word can be decreased by repeating the word in the study list or by otherwise making certain words more salient. Experiment 4, 5 and 7 showed that response latency was affected by similarities between target and distractor words and by such word characteristics as frequency, concreteness, and syllable length. The latency and error data were discussed in terms of a moedl for recognition which assumes that the subject either (1) makes an initial fast response based on the familiarity of the test word or (2) if the familiarity is neitger high nor low, delays responding until an extended search of the emorized list is carried out. Quantitative predictions generated by the model compare favorably with the data.},

Thus, trials with a signal presentation consist of a mixture of 2 (or more) latent classes of trials.

For example, mixture SDT offers an alternative to the unequal variance signal detection model; it can also account for nonlinear normal receiver operating characteristic curves, as found in recent research.},

In a preceding paper, Glanzer, Hilfor, and Maloney /psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 16, 431-455, 2009) showed that the likelihood ratio assumption implies that three regularities will occur in recognition memory: (1) the Mirror Effect, (2) the Variance Effect, (3) the normalized Receiver Operating Characteristic (z-ROC) Length Effect. The paper offered formal proofs and computational demosntrations that decisions based on likelihood ratios produce the three regularities. A survey of data ased on group ROCs from 36 studies validated the likelihood ratio assumption by showing that its three implied regularities are ubiquituous. The study noted, however, that bias, another basis factor in Signal Detection Theory, can obscure the Mirror Effect. In this paper we examine how bias affects the regularities at the theoretical leve. The theoretical analysis shows: (1) how bias obscures the Mirror Effect, not the other two reguarities, and (2) four ways to counter that obscuring. We then report the results of five experiments that support the theoretical analysis. The analyses and the experimental results also demonstrate: (1) that the three regularities govern individual, as well as group, performance, (2) alternative explanations of the regularities are ruled oyt, and (3) tat Signal Detection Theory, correctly applied, gives a simple and unified explanation of recognition memory data.},

Their papers, and especially a paper by Grier (1971) that provided computing formulas for the measures, continue to be heavily cited in a wide range of content areas. In our sample of articles, most authors described triangle-based measures as making fewer assumptions than measures associated with detection theory. However, we show that statistics based on products or ratios of right triangle areas, including recently proposed bias index and not-yet-proposed but apparently plausible sensitivity index, are consistent with a decision process based on logistic distributions. Even the Pollack and Norman measure, which is based on non-right triangles, is approximately logistic for low values of sensitivity.

In analyses with nonlinear models, unmodeled variability from the selection of items or participants may lead to asymptotically biased estimation. This asymptotic bias, in turn, renders inference problematic. We show, for example, that a signal detection analysis of recognition memory data leads to asymptotic underestimation of sensitivity. To eliminate asymptotic bias, we advocate hierarchical models in which participant variaility, item bariability and measurement error are modeled simultaneously. By accounting for multiple sources of variability, hierarchical models yield consistent and accurate estimates of participant and item effects in recognition memory.

Are the latter simpy a rehash of the former? Here, we make ana ttempt to distinguish precisely between optimal and probabilistic computation. In optimal computation, the observer minimizes the expected cost under a posterior probability distribution. In probabilistic computation, the observer uses higher moments of the likelihood functon of the stimulus on a tria-by-trial basis. Computation can be optimal without being probabilistic and vice-versa. Most signal detection theory models describe optimal computation. Behavioral data only provide evidence for a neural representation of uncertaity if they are best described by a model of probabilistic computation. We argue that single-neuron activity sometimes suffices for optimal computation, but never for probabilistic computation. A population code is needed instead. Not every population code is equally suitable, because nusance parameters have to be marginalized out. This problem is solved by Poisson-like, but not by Gaussian bariability. Finally we build a dictionary between signal detection theory quantities and Poisson.like population quantities.},

@article{Wixted2007,
	Abstract = {Two influential models of recognition memory, the unequal variance signal-detection model and a dual-process threshold/detection model accurately describe the receiver operating characteristic, but only the latter model can provide estimates of recollection and familiarity. Such estimates often accord with those provided by the remember-know procedure, and both methods are now widely used in the neuroscience literature to identify the brain correlates of recollection and familiarity. However, in recent years, a substantial literature has accumulated directly contrasting the signal-detection model against the threshold/Detection-model, and that litrature is almost unanimous in its endorsement of signal detection theory. A dual process version of signal detection theory implies that individual recgnition decisions are not process pure, and it suggest new ways to investigate the brain correlates of recognition memory.},
