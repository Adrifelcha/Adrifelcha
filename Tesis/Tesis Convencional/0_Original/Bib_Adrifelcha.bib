	Abstract = {Seven experiments, designed to investigate the effects of various factors on word recognition, are reported. For each experiment the subject memorized a list of from 16 to 54 words and then was tested with a sequence of single words; each test involved weither a target word (member of the list) or distractor word (not on the memorized list). In response to each test word the subject pressed one of two keys, indicating whether the word was a target or a distractor. Response latency was shown to depend upon the number of prior tests on a given word (Experiment 1) and the length of the target list (Experiment 2). Experiment 3 and 6 demonstrated that response latency to a target word can be decreased by repeating the word in the study list or by otherwise making certain words more salient. Experiment 4, 5 and 7 showed that response latency was affected by similarities between target and distractor words and by such word characteristics as frequency, concreteness, and syllable length. The latency and error data were discussed in terms of a moedl for recognition which assumes that the subject either (1) makes an initial fast response based on the familiarity of the test word or (2) if the familiarity is neitger high nor low, delays responding until an extended search of the emorized list is carried out. Quantitative predictions generated by the model compare favorably with the data.},

The model has two parameters representing the rate of indirect marking for high-frequency and low-frequency words and two parameters reflecting the efficiency of direct marking. The latency results completely paralleled the accuracy findings, showing proactive and retroactive effects. A possible extension of the model to handle latencies is considered.},

The paper offered formal proofs and computational demosntrations that decisions based on likelihood ratios produce the three regularities. A survey of data ased on group ROCs from 36 studies validated the likelihood ratio assumption by showing that its three implied regularities are ubiquituous. The study noted, however, that bias, another basis factor in Signal Detection Theory, can obscure the Mirror Effect. In this paper we examine how bias affects the regularities at the theoretical leve. The theoretical analysis shows: (1) how bias obscures the Mirror Effect, not the other two reguarities, and (2) four ways to counter that obscuring. We then report the results of five experiments that support the theoretical analysis. The analyses and the experimental results also demonstrate: (1) that the three regularities govern individual, as well as group, performance, (2) alternative explanations of the regularities are ruled oyt, and (3) tat Signal Detection Theory, correctly applied, gives a simple and unified explanation of recognition memory data.},

The learning data were in agreement with a Markov model which requires a constant error probability in the initial state. The The confidence judgments were used to construct memory-operating characteristics. The MOC based upon all scores of the first test trial is smooth and symmetric and indicates good discrimination. MOCs were also constructed from scores of the first test trial which were followed by an error on some later trial, and from all scores before the last error. These two MOCs overlapped and were in between the MOC based upon all first-trial scores and the chance line. It is concluded that on trials before the last error Ss possess some information about the learning material but that the amount of information does not increase during those trials.},

The theory and the effect were studied using speed versus accuracy instructions and short versus long exposure of stimuli. Speed versus accuracy instructions during test and short versus long exposure of stimuli during study were used to vary the number of features sampled from stimuli. When the number of features sampled was reduced either by speed instructions or by shorter exposure, recognition performance was impaired. The theory predicts that in such cases, all distances between underlying distributions will contract. That means, moreover, that when recognition accuracy is decreased for old stimuli, it is also decreased for new stimuli. These predictions were supported by the data from three experiments.},

To introduce this special issue, we discuss four of the most important potential hierarchical Bayesian contributions. The first involves the development of more complete theories, including accounting for variation coming from sources like individual differences in cognition. The second involves the capability to account for observed behavior in terms of the combination of multiple different cognitive processes. The third involves using a few key psychological variables to explain behavior on a wide range of cognitive tasks. The fourth involves the conceptual unification and integration of disparate cognitive models. For all of these potential contributions, we outline an appropriate general hierarchical Bayesian modeling structure.

Identification refers to the matching of elements of the formal theory with constructs constituting a theory of memory. A number of issues are raised concerning the identification of the sensory continuum, the decision axis, and the distinction between signal and noise. The use of detection theory is not a theoretically neutral method of dealing with response bias; the validity of its use and the manner of its application depend heavily on certain assumptions about the memory system. The form of the operating characteristic can be used to test a number of these assumptions but such tests are relatively insensitive.

Even the Pollack and Norman measure, which is based on non-right triangles, is approximately logistic for low values of sensitivity.

The theory applies to both recognition and recall and covers both accuracy and latency.

Performance is predicted from the moments (expectation and variance) of the similarity distributions, and these can be derived from the theory.

The symmetry arises because subjects use the likelihood ratio as the basis for decision. The author analyzes the model and argues that one of the main criticisms (the complexity of the likelihood-ratio decision rule) is unwarranted. A further analysis shows that other distributions (the Poisson and the hypergeometric) can also produce a mirror effect. Even with the binomial distribution, a variety of parameter values can produce a mirror effect, and with the right combination of parameter values, differential attention across conditions is not necessary for a mirror effect to occur.},

There were no effects of attention on the waveforms elicited by words. These results support the view that processing becomes automatic for words, whereas the processing of pictures involves additional effort or allocation of attentional resources. The N450 amplitude was greater for words than for pictures during both acquisition (intentional items) and recognition phases (hit and correct rejection categories for intentional items, hit category for incidental items). Because pictures are better remembered than words, the greater late positive wave (600 ms) elicited by the pictures than the words during the acquisition phase is also consistent with the association between P300 and better memory that has been reported.},

The advantage for low-frequency words relative to high-frequency words was greater with the lexical-decision orienting task than with either of the other orienting tasks. Experiment 2 used self-paced presentation to show that study time is a monotonically decreasing function of linguistic frequency. Thus, recognition for high-frequency words may suffer, in part, from less processing than that performed for low-frequency words. The poor recognition accuracy for very low-frequency words, however, apparently is not due to a deficient amount of processing but rather to limitations in the effectiveness of the processing that is performed.},

In analyses with nonlinear models, unmodeled variability from the selection of items or participants may lead to asymptotically biased estimation. This asymptotic bias, in turn, renders inference problematic. We show, for example, that a signal detection analysis of recognition memory data leads to asymptotic underestimation of sensitivity. To eliminate asymptotic bias, we advocate hierarchical models in which participant variaility, item bariability and measurement error are modeled simultaneously. By accounting for multiple sources of variability, hierarchical models yield consistent and accurate estimates of participant and item effects in recognition memory.

	Abstract = {Presents a sample of empirical relative operating characteristics (ROCs), drawn both from discrimination tasks in experimental psychology and from diagnostic tasks in several practical fields. These illustrative ROCs are seen to be fitted well by a straight line, of varying slope, on a binormal graph. The form of empirical ROCs is consistent with one version of the variable-criterion model provided by signal detection theory and inconsistent both with other versions of that model and with the main threshold models. That form supports the use of certain indices of discrimination accuracy derived from detection theory and substantiates the potential unreliability of others of that heritage and, more importantly, the unreliability of the several accuracy indices in common use that can be shown to imply one or another threshold model. The preferred detection-theory indices of accuracy are ones that accommodate the varying slope of empirical ROCs. These indices are effectively independent of the decision criterion, which can be indexed separately. Measuring both accuracy and the decision criterion appropriately enables the delineation of the dependent variables affected by independent variables in psychological studies and the assessment of the efficacy and accuracy of diagnostic systems.

	Abstract = {Most models of recognition memory rely on a strength/familiarity-based signal detection account that assumes that the processes giving rise to a confidence judgment are the same as those giving rise to an old-new decision. Confidence is assumed to be scaled directly from the perceived familiarity of a probe. This assumption was tested in 2 experiments that examine the shape of confidence-based z receiver operating characteristic (zROC) curves under different levels of response bias induced by changing stimulus probabilities (Experiment 1) and payoffs (Experiment 2). Changes in the shape of the zRQC curves with bias indicate that confidence is not scaled directly from perceived familiarity or likelihood. A model of information accumulation in recognition memory is proposed that can account for the observed effects.},

	Abstract = {A novel experimental paradigm for measuring state paranoia by means of signal detection theory was evaluated. A liberal response bias, indicating the tendency to recognize facial expressions as threatening was expected to reflect paranoia. Against theoretical expectations, heightened paranoia questionnaire scores were associated with a non-liberal bias, which was not affected by negative emotion per se. However, subsequent analyses revealed that, if anxious participants with heightened paranoia adopted a comparatively ore liberal response bias. These findings corroborate the eminent role of anxiety in paranoia and demonstrate that state paranoia can be captured with the present paradigm},

	Abstract = {The juxtaposition of established signal detection theory models of perception and more recent claims about the encoding of uncertainty in perception is a rich source of confusion. Are the latter simpy a rehash of the former? Here, we make ana ttempt to distinguish precisely between optimal and probabilistic computation. In optimal computation, the observer minimizes the expected cost under a posterior probability distribution. In probabilistic computation, the observer uses higher moments of the likelihood functon of the stimulus on a tria-by-trial basis. Computation can be optimal without being probabilistic and vice-versa. Most signal detection theory models describe optimal computation. Behavioral data only provide evidence for a neural representation of uncertaity if they are best described by a model of probabilistic computation. We argue that single-neuron activity sometimes suffices for optimal computation, but never for probabilistic computation. A population code is needed instead. Not every population code is equally suitable, because nusance parameters have to be marginalized out. This problem is solved by Poisson-like, but not by Gaussian bariability. Finally we build a dictionary between signal detection theory quantities and Poisson.like population quantities.},

@article{White1999,
	Abstract = {We present a new model of remembering in the context of conditional discrimination. For procedures such as delayed matching to sample, the effect of the sample stimuli at the time of remembering is represented by a pair of Thurstonian (normal) distributions of effective stimulus values. The critical assumption of the model is that, based on prior experience, each effective stimulus value is associated with a ratio of reinforcers obtained for previous correct choices of the comparison stimuli. That ratio determines the choice that is made on the basis of the matching law. The standard deviations of the distributions are assumed to increase with increasing retention-interval duration, and the distance between their means is assumed to be a function of other factors that influence overall difficulty of the discrimination. It is a behavioral model in that choice is determined by its reinforcement history. The model predicts that the biasing effects of the reinforcer differential increase with decreasing discriminability and with increasing retention-interval duration. Data from several conditions using a delayed matching-to-sample procedure with pigeons support the predictions.},

The principal theoretical findings are: (a) strength in short-term memory (STM) appears to decay exponentially with the number of subsequent items; (b) subjects report that they recognize an item if and only if strength in memory exceeds a criterion; (c) the first item of a list is remembered better than subsequent items because it receives a greater increment in strength in STM upon presentation, not because it decays more slowly in STM or because it acquires some strength in a longterm memory.},

	Abstract = {The mirror effect refers to the common finding that hit and false alarm rates on a recognition test are inversely related. The present research investigated the generality of the mirror effect (to rare words) and tested whether the effect might be grounded in accurate estimates of word memorability. The first 2 experiments showed that although high- and low-frequency words exhibit a mirror effect, rare words do not. Furthermore, contrary' to expectations. Ss consistently (and mistakenly) predicted that memorability was directly correlated with frequency of usage. These findings weigh against the idea that the mirror effect arises because of a S's ability to reject low-frequency lures on the grounds that such words would have been remembered had they appeared previously. Instead, the rejection of lures from different frequency categories may be determined by their semantic or phonemic overlap with list targets, and an analysis along these lines may help to explain why rare words constitute an exception to the otherwise ubiquitous mirror effect.},

Such estimates often accord with those provided by the remember-know procedure, and both methods are now widely used in the neuroscience literature to identify the brain correlates of recollection and familiarity. However, in recent years, a substantial literature has accumulated directly contrasting the signal-detection model against the threshold/Detection-model, and that litrature is almost unanimous in its endorsement of signal detection theory. A dual process version of signal detection theory implies that individual recgnition decisions are not process pure, and it suggest new ways to investigate the brain correlates of recognition memory.},

@article{Yonelinas1996,
	Abstract = {Threshold- and signal-detection-based models have dominated theorizing about recognition memory. Building upon these theoretical frameworks, we have argued for a dualprocess model in which conscious recollection (a threshold process) and familiarity (a signal-detection process) contribute to memory performance. In the current paper we assessed several memory models by examining the effects of levels of processing and the number of presentations on recognition memory receiver operating characteristics (ROCs). In general, when the ROCs were plotted in probability space they exhibited an inverted U shape; however, when they were plotted in z space they exhibited a U shape. An examination of the ROCs showed that the dual-process model could account for the observed ROCs, but that models based solely on either threshold or signal-detection processes failed to provide a sufficient account of the data. Furthermore, an examination of subjects’ introspective reports using the remember/know procedure showed that subjects were aware of recollection and familiarity and were able to consistently report on their occurrence. The remember/know data were used to accurately predict the shapes of the ROCs, and estimates of recollection and familiarity derived from the ROC data mirrored the subjective reports of these processes.},
