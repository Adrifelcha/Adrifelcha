    Several current theories of the response process in recognition memory, or
  in confidence rating in recall, have postulated a continuous decision process
  as in the theory of signal detectability. This assumption, however, does not
  rule out assuming that the process by which information is stored and
  retained in memory is a discrete one. In the finite-state decision theory
  presented here, the continuous decision process is combined with a
  representation of the memory trace as a tag that is either available or not
  available at the time of test. In its predictions for recognition memory
  experiments, this theory is at least the equal of theories based on
  traditional habit strength assumptions. Furthermore, data from studies of
  confidence ratings in recall provide considerable support for the
  finite-state assumption.%

    A stimulus-sampling model of recognition memory is presented that predicts
  both proactive and retroactive interference. To test the predictions of the
  model, a recognition memory experiment was carried out using a standard
  proactive-retroactive design with a forced-choice task. Both accuracy and
  latency were measured. The data showed, as predicted, equal proactive and
  retroactive effects on accuracy, providing solid support for the model. The
  interference effects are interpreted in terms of the model as arising from an
  increase in indirect marking, the marking of shared stimulus elements in
  words other than the study word. The model has two parameters representing
  the rate of indirect marking for high-frequency and low-frequency words and
  two parameters reflecting the efficiency of direct marking. The latency
  results completely paralleled the accuracy findings, showing proactive and
  retroactive effects. A possible extension of the model to handle latencies is
  considered.%

    An extension of signal detection theory (SDT) that incorporates mixtures of
  the underlying distributions is presented. The mixtures can be motivated by
  the idea that a presentation fo a signal shifts the location of anunderlying
  distribution only if the observer is attending to the signal; otherwise, the
  distribution is not shifted or is only partially shifted. Thus, trials with a
  signal presentation consist of a mixture of 2 (or more) latent classes of
  trials. Mixture SDT provides a general theoretical framework that offers a
  new perspective on a number of findings. For example, mixture SDT offers an
  alternative to the unequal variance signal detection model; it can also
  account for nonlinear normal receiver operating characteristic curves, as
  found in recent research.%

    The mirror effect for word frequency refers to the finding that
  low-frequency words have higher hit rates and lower false alarm rates that
  high-frequency words. This result is typically interpreted in terms of
  conventional signa detection theory (SDT), in which case it indicates that
  the order of the underlying old item distributions mirrors the order of the
  new item distributions. However, when viewed in terms of a mixture revision
  of SDT, the order of hits and false alarms does not neccesarily imply the
  same order in the underlying distributions because of possible effects of
  mixing. A reversal in underlying distributions did not appear for fits of
  mixture SDT models to data from 4 experiments.%

    A model of cued recall called CHARM (composite holographic associative

  the to-be-remembered items themselves, CHARM can account for the main effect

    The Search of Associative Memory (SAM) model for recall (Raaijmakers &
  Shiffrin, 1981b) is extended by assuming that a familiarity process is used
  for recognition. The recall model posits cue-dependent probabilistic sampling
  and recovery from an associative network. Our recognition model is closely
  related to the recall model because the total episodic activation due to the
  context and item cues is used in recall as a basis for sampling and in
  recognition to make a decision. The model, formalized in a computer
  simulation program, correctly predicts a number of findings in the literature
  as well as the results from a new experiment on the wordfrequency effect.%

    The mirror effect is a strong regularity in recognition memory: If there
  are two conditions, A and B, with A giving higher recognition accuracy, then
  old items in A are recognized as old better than old items in B, and also new
  items in A are recognized as new better than new items in B. The mirror
  effect is explained by attention/likelihood theory, which also makes several
  new, counterintuitive predictions. One is that any variable, such as
  forgetting, that affects recognition changes the responses to new as well as
  old stimuli. In terms of underlying distributions, forgetting produces
  concentering, the bilateral movement of distributions, both new (noise) and
  old (signal), toward a midpoint. Data from two forced-choice experiments are
  reported that support the prediction of concentering and other predictions
  drawn from the theory. It is argued that current theories of memory': which
  are strength theories, cannot handle these regularities.%

    We analyze four general signal detection models for recognition memory that
  differ in their distributional assumptions. Our analyses show that a basic
  assumption of signal detection theory, the likelihood ratio decision axis,
  implies three regularities in recognition memory: (1) the mirror effect, (2)
  the variance effect, and (3) the z-ROC length effect. For each model, we
  present the equations that produce the three regularities and show, in
  computed examples, how they do so. We then show that the regularities appear
  in data from a range of recognition studies. The analyses and data in our
  study support the following generalization: Individuals make efficient
  recognition decisions on the basis of likelihood ratios.%

    Response distribution has recently been proposed as an explanation of the
  mirror effect in recognition memory. According to the proposal, participants
  presented with distinctive sets of items (e.g., low- and high-frequency
  words) vary their responses to give an equal number of positive responses
  (e.g., the sum of hits and false alarms) to each set. Four experiments tested
  this proposal. Two experiments showed that the mirror effect is present in
  the absence of distinctive sets of items. Two experiments showed that the
  mirror effect is present in the absence of response equalization. Wherever
  the response distribution hypothesis can be tested, it fails.%

    Three regularities in recognitionmemory are described with supporting data:
  the mirror effect, the order of receiver operating characteristic slopes, and
  the symmetry of movement of underlying distributions. The derivation of these
  regularities from attention/likelihood theory is demosntrated. The theory's
  central concept, which distinguishes it from other theories, is the
  following: Ss make recognition decisions by combining information about new
  and old items, the combination made in the form of likelihood ratios. The
  central role of the likelihood rations extends the implications of signal
  detection theory for recognition memory. Attention/likelihood theory is
  fitted to data of 2 series of experiments. One series involves yes-no tests
  and confidence ratings, the other forced-choice experiments. It is argued
  that the regularities require a revision of most current theories of
  recognition memory%

    A basic assumption of Signal Detection Theory is that decisions are made on
  the basis of likelihood ratios. In a preceding paper, Glanzer, Hilfor, and
  Maloney /psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 16, 431-455, 2009) showed that the
  likelihood ratio assumption implies that three regularities will occur in
  recognition memory: (1) the Mirror Effect, (2) the Variance Effect, (3) the
  normalized Receiver Operating Characteristic (z-ROC) Length Effect. The paper
  offered formal proofs and computational demosntrations that decisions based
  on likelihood ratios produce the three regularities. A survey of data ased on
  group ROCs from 36 studies validated the likelihood ratio assumption by
  showing that its three implied regularities are ubiquituous. The study noted,
  however, that bias, another basis factor in Signal Detection Theory, can
  obscure the Mirror Effect. In this paper we examine how bias affects the
  regularities at the theoretical leve. The theoretical analysis shows: (1) how
  bias obscures the Mirror Effect, not the other two reguarities, and (2) four
  ways to counter that obscuring. We then report the results of five
  experiments that support the theoretical analysis. The analyses and the
  experimental results also demonstrate: (1) that the three regularities govern
  individual, as well as group, performance, (2) alternative explanations of
  the regularities are ruled oyt, and (3) tat Signal Detection Theory,
  correctly applied, gives a simple and unified explanation of recognition
  memory data.%

    Two points are made in relation to the recent article by K. Kim and M.
  Glanzer (1993). First, the attention-likelihood model is more complex than
  these authors and others suggest. In particular, 2 kinds of quantities—(a)
  parameters representing the true state of the subject's memory and (b) the
  subject's estimates of those parameters—have been referred to using the
  same symbols. This obscures the essential role of metamemory in the model's
  predictions. Second, log-likelihood rescaling is not needed to explain the
  mirror effect. An alternative rescaling scheme is described, which can be
  added to a variety of memory models. This new rescaling method estimates a
  test item's learnability by learning it. Simulations show that the method is
  consistent with Kim and Glanzer's experimental results.%

    Attention/likelihood theory is a model of recognition memory designed to
  explain the mirror effect (Glanzer & Adams, 1985, 1990). The theory and the
  effect were studied using speed versus accuracy instructions and short versus
  long exposure of stimuli. Speed versus accuracy instructions during test and
  short versus long exposure of stimuli during study were used to vary the
  number of features sampled from stimuli. When the number of features sampled
  was reduced either by speed instructions or by shorter exposure, recognition
  performance was impaired. The theory predicts that in such cases, all
  distances between underlying distributions will contract. That means,
  moreover, that when recognition accuracy is decreased for old stimuli, it is
  also decreased for new stimuli. These predictions were supported by the data
  from three experiments.%

  established which divide this scale into separate regions corresponding to

    Four Ss learned to recognize 30 lists of paired associates. Confidence
  judgments were obtained with all responses. The learning data were in
  agreement with a Markov model which requires a constant error probability in
  the initial state. The The confidence judgments were used to construct
  memory-operating characteristics. The MOC based upon all scores of the first
  test trial is smooth and symmetric and indicates good discrimination. MOCs
  were also constructed from scores of the first test trial which were followed
  by an error on some later trial, and from all scores before the last error.
  These two MOCs overlapped and were in between the MOC based upon all

    Hierarchical Bayesian modeling provides a flexible and interpretable way of
  extending simple models of cognitive processes. To introduce this special
  issue, we discuss four of the most important potential hierarchical Bayesian
  contributions. The first involves the development of more complete theories,
  including accounting for variation coming from sources like individual
  differences in cognition. The second involves the capability to account for
  observed behavior in terms of the combination of multiple different cognitive
  processes. The third involves using a few key psychological variables to
  explain behavior on a wide range of cognitive tasks. The fourth involves the
  conceptual unification and integration of disparate cognitive models. For all
  of these potential contributions, we outline an appropriate general
  hierarchical Bayesian modeling structure. We also highlight current models
  that already use the hierarchical Bayesian approach, as well as identifying
  research areas that could benefit from its adoption.%

    The use of signal detection theory as a model of the decision process in
  memory is discussed in terms of the problems of identification and testing.
  Identification refers to the matching of elements of the formal theory with
  constructs constituting a theory of memory. A number of issues are raised
  concerning the identification of the sensory continuum, the decision axis,
  and the distinction between signal and noise. The use of detection theory is
  not a theoretically neutral method of dealing with response bias; the
  validity of its use and the manner of its application depend heavily on
  certain assumptions about the memory system. The form of the operating
  characteristic can be used to test a number of these assumptions but such
  tests are relatively insensitive. The use of detection theory in the analysis
  of cued-recall data poses additional problems and is meaningful in the
  context of some, but not all, theories of recall.%

    The juxtaposition of established signal detection theory models of
  perception and more recent claims about the encoding of uncertainty in
  perception is a rich source of confusion. Are the latter simpy a rehash of
  the former? Here, we make ana ttempt to distinguish precisely between optimal
  and probabilistic computation. In optimal computation, the observer minimizes
  the expected cost under a posterior probability distribution. In
  probabilistic computation, the observer uses higher moments of the likelihood
  functon of the stimulus on a tria-by-trial basis. Computation can be optimal
  without being probabilistic and vice-versa. Most signal detection theory
  models describe optimal computation. Behavioral data only provide evidence
  for a neural representation of uncertaity if they are best described by a
  model of probabilistic computation. We argue that single-neuron activity
  sometimes suffices for optimal computation, but never for probabilistic
  computation. A population code is needed instead. Not every population code
  is equally suitable, because nusance parameters have to be marginalized out.
  This problem is solved by Poisson-like, but not by Gaussian bariability.
  Finally we build a dictionary between signal detection theory quantities and
  Poisson.like population quantities.%

    Can accuracy and response bias in two-stimulus, two-response recognition or
  detection experiments be measured nonparametrically? Pollack and Norman
  (1964) answered this question affirmatively for sensitivity, Hodos (1970) for
  bias: Both proposed measures based on triangular areas in receiver-operating
  characteristic space. Their papers, and especially a paper by Grier (1971)
  that provided computing formulas for the measures, continue to be heavily
  cited in a wide range of content areas. In our sample of articles, most
  authors described triangle-based measures as making fewer assumptions than
  measures associated with detection theory. However, we show that statistics
  based on products or ratios of right triangle areas, including recently
  proposed bias index and not-yet-proposed but apparently plausible sensitivity
  index, are consistent with a decision process based on logistic
  distributions. Even the Pollack and Norman measure, which is based on
  non-right triangles, is approximately logistic for low values of sensitivity.
  Simple geometric models for sensitivity and bias are not nonparametric, even
  if their implications are not acknowledged in the defining publications%

  plus a confidence rating. From these data ROC curves were plotted, and they
  resembled the curvilinear functions of signal-detection theory more than the

    TA theory for the storage and retrieval of item and associative information
  is presented. In the theory, items or events are represented as random
  vectors. Convolution is used as the storage operation, and correlation is
  used as the retrieval operation. A distributed-memory system is assumed; all
  information is stored in a common memory vector. The theory applies to both
  recognition and recall and covers both accuracy and latency. Noise in the
  decision stag necessitates a two-criterion decision system, and over time the
  criteria converge until a decision is reached. Performance is predicted from
  the moments (expectation and variance) of the similarity distributions, and
  these can be derived from the theory. Several alternative models with varying
  degrees of distributed memory are considered, and expressions for
  signal-to-noise ratio and relative efficiency are derived.%

    The mirror effect refers to findings from studies of recognition memory
  consistent with the idea that the underlying "strength" distributions are
  symmetric around their midpoint separating studied and nonstudied items.
  Attention-likelihood theory assumes underlying binomial distributions of
  marked features and claims that old-item differences result from differential
  attention across conditions during study. The symmetry arises because
  subjects use the likelihood ratio as the basis for decision. The author
  analyzes the model and argues that one of the main criticisms (the complexity
  of the likelihood-ratio decision rule) is unwarranted. A further analysis
  shows that other distributions (the Poisson and the hypergeometric) can also
  produce a mirror effect. Even with the binomial distribution, a variety of
  parameter values can produce a mirror effect, and with the right combination
  of parameter values, differential attention across conditions is not
  necessary for a mirror effect to occur.%

    A review of Signal Detection Theory and Psychophysics in the Journal of the
  Experimental Analysis of Behavior is justified by the growing interest in
  signal detection among many psychologist concerned with operant behavior. The
  nteractions of wavelngth discrimination and reinforcement (Boneau, Holland
  and Baker, 1965) have been examined within a detection-theory framework
  (Nevin,1965), and a full-blown decision theory of animal discrimination
  performance has been published (Bonea and Cole, 1967). Blough (1967) has used
  signal-detection analysis to present wavelength generalization gradients in a
  novel way, and Rilling and Mc Diarmid (1969) and Stubbs (1968) have extended
  this analysis to the study of response-produced and temporal stimuli. Most
  recently, Blough (1969) has considered signal detection theory as an
  alternative to traditional formulatios of stimulus generalization. A
  knowledge of signal detection theory is therefore important for its relevance
  to perant research as well as for its central position in sensory
  psychology.%

    Event-related potentials were recorded under conditions of intentional or
  incidental learning of pictures and words, and during the subsequent
  recognition memory test for these stimuli. Intentionally learned pictures
  were remembered better than incidentally learned pictures and intentionally
  learned words, which, in turn, were remembered better than incidentally
  learned words. In comparison to pictures that were ignored, the pictures that
  were attended were characterized by greater positive amplitude frontally at
  250 ms and centro-parietally at 350 ms and by greater negativity at 450 ms at
  parietal and occipital sites. There were no effects of attention on the
  waveforms elicited by words. These results support the view that processing
  becomes automatic for words, whereas the processing of pictures involves
  additional effort or allocation of attentional resources. The N450 amplitude
  was greater for words than for pictures during both acquisition (intentional
  items) and recognition phases (hit and correct rejection categories for
  intentional items, hit category for incidental items). Because pictures are
  better remembered than words, the greater late positive wave (600 ms)
  elicited by the pictures than the words during the acquisition phase is also
  consistent with the association between P300 and better memory that has been
  reported.%

    The operating characteristic is used to examine the relation between the

    Psychophysical signal-detection theory is applied to recognition-memory
  performance. Old items in the test list are considered to be analogous to
  "signals" while new items are analogous to "noise only." The resulting
  fundamental assumptions describe the covert responses which mediate
  recognition-memory performance as varying continuously in strength. Covert
  responses to both old and new items are normally distributed with the
  distance between distributions representing learning and retention. The overt
  response to an item depends on whether or not S's covert response exceeds an
  arbitrary criterion. The available evidence suggests that S's criterion will
  be set such that he will most probably choose a number of items approximately

    Accuracy on recognition-memory tests has been found to be an inverted
  U-shaped function of linguistic frequency. The present experiments were
  designed to provide insight into the basis for this relationship. Experiment
  1 demonstrated that the inverted U-shaped function is obtained not only when
  a semantic orienting task (in this case, a lexical-decision task) is
  performed during the study phase but also when either a syllable-counting
  task is performed or nondirected study is allowed. The advantage for
  low-frequency words relative to high-frequency words was greater with the
  lexical-decision orienting task than with either of the other orienting
  tasks. Experiment 2 used self-paced presentation to show that study time is a
  monotonically decreasing function of linguistic frequency. Thus, recognition
  for high-frequency words may suffer, in part, from less processing than that
  performed for low-frequency words. The poor recognition accuracy for very
  low-frequency words, however, apparently is not due to a deficient amount of
  processing but rather to limitations in the effectiveness of the processing
  that is performed.%

    Global memory models are evaluated by using data from recognition memory
  experiments. For recognition, each of the models gives a value of familiarity
  as the output from matching a test item against memory. The experiments
  provide ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves that give information
  about the standard deviations of familiarity values for old and new test
  items in the models. The experimental results are consistent with normal
  distributions of familiarity (a prediction of the models). However, the
  results also show that the new-item familiarity standard deviation is about
  0.8 that of the old-item familiarity standard deviation and independent of
  the strength of the old items (under the assumption of normality). The models
  are inconsistent with these results because they predict either nearly equal
  old and new standard deviations or increasing values of old standard
  deviation with strength. Thus, the data provide the basis for revision of
  current models or development of new models.%

    The experiments presented in this article examined the slope of the z-ROC
  (receiver-operating characteristic) function for recognition memory. The
  slope was examined as a function of strength and the variables study time,
  list length, word frequency, and category membership. For normal
  distributions of familiarity, the slope of the z-ROC is the ratio of the
  new-item to old-item standard deviations. R. Ratcliff, C.-F. Sheu, and S. D.
  Gronlund (1992) found that the slope was constant within standard error as a
  function of strength of encoding, which is inconsistent with the predictions
  of the global memory models. The results presented here extend this finding:
  The slope was constant as a function of strength of encoding, list length,
  and the number of related items from a category in the study list. Word
  frequency did affect the slope, but within a frequency class the slope was
  constant as a function of strength. The implications of these data for the
  global memory models, the attention likelihood model, and variants of these
  models are discussed.%

    Presents a sample of empirical relative operating characteristics (ROCs),
  drawn both from discrimination tasks in experimental psychology and from
  diagnostic tasks in several practical fields. These illustrative ROCs are
  seen to be fitted well by a straight line, of varying slope, on a binormal
  graph. The form of empirical ROCs is consistent with one version of the
  variable-criterion model provided by signal detection theory and inconsistent
  both with other versions of that model and with the main threshold models.
  That form supports the use of certain indices of discrimination accuracy
  derived from detection theory and substantiates the potential unreliability
  of others of that heritage and, more importantly, the unreliability of the
  several accuracy indices in common use that can be shown to imply one or
  another threshold model. The preferred detection-theory indices of accuracy
  are ones that accommodate the varying slope of empirical ROCs. These indices
  are effectively independent of the decision criterion, which can be indexed
  separately. Measuring both accuracy and the decision criterion appropriately
  enables the delineation of the dependent variables affected by independent
  variables in psychological studies and the assessment of the efficacy and
  accuracy of diagnostic systems. (43 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016

  affected by negative emotion per se. However, subsequent analyses revealed
  that, if anxious participants with heightened paranoia adopted a
  comparatively ore liberal response bias. These findings corroborate the
  eminent role of anxiety in paranoia and demonstrate that state paranoia can
  be captured with the present paradigm%

    We present a new model of remembering in the context of conditional
  discrimination. For procedures such as delayed matching to sample, the effect
  of the sample stimuli at the time of remembering is represented by a pair of
  Thurstonian (normal) distributions of effective stimulus values. The critical
  assumption of the model is that, based on prior experience, each effective
  stimulus value is associated with a ratio of reinforcers obtained for
  previous correct choices of the comparison stimuli. That ratio determines the
  choice that is made on the basis of the matching law. The standard deviations
  of the distributions are assumed to increase with increasing
  retention-interval duration, and the distance between their means is assumed
  to be a function of other factors that influence overall difficulty of the
  discrimination. It is a behavioral model in that choice is determined by its
  reinforcement history. The model predicts that the biasing effects of the
  reinforcer differential increase with decreasing discriminability and with
  increasing retention-interval duration. Data from several conditions using a
  delayed matching-to-sample procedure with pigeons support the predictions.%

  bias, are obtained by means of the operating characteristic. The principal

  decay exponentially with the number of subsequent items; (b) subjects report
  that they recognize an item if and only if strength in memory exceeds a
  criterion; (c) the first item of a list is remembered better than subsequent

    The mirror effect refers to the common finding that hit and false alarm
  rates on a recognition test are inversely related. The present research
  investigated the generality of the mirror effect (to rare words) and tested
  whether the effect might be grounded in accurate estimates of word
  memorability. The first 2 experiments showed that although high- and
  low-frequency words exhibit a mirror effect, rare words do not. Furthermore,
  contrary' to expectations. Ss consistently (and mistakenly) predicted that
  memorability was directly correlated with frequency of usage. These findings
  weigh against the idea that the mirror effect arises because of a S's ability
  to reject low-frequency lures on the grounds that such words would have been
  remembered had they appeared previously. Instead, the rejection of lures from
  different frequency categories may be determined by their semantic or
  phonemic overlap with list targets, and an analysis along these lines may
  help to explain why rare words constitute an exception to the otherwise
  ubiquitous mirror effect.%

    Two influential models of recognition memory, the unequal variance
  signal-detection model and a dual-process threshold/detection model
  accurately describe the receiver operating characteristic, but only the
  latter model can provide estimates of recollection and familiarity. Such
  estimates often accord with those provided by the remember-know procedure,
  and both methods are now widely used in the neuroscience literature to
  identify the brain correlates of recollection and familiarity. However, in
  recent years, a substantial literature has accumulated directly contrasting
  the signal-detection model against the threshold/Detection-model, and that
  litrature is almost unanimous in its endorsement of signal detection theory.
  A dual process version of signal detection theory implies that individual
  recgnition decisions are not process pure, and it suggest new ways to
  investigate the brain correlates of recognition memory.%

    Threshold- and signal-detection-based models have dominated theorizing
  about recognition memory. Building upon these theoretical frameworks, we have
  argued for a dualprocess model in which conscious recollection (a threshold
  process) and familiarity (a signal-detection process) contribute to memory
  performance. In the current paper we assessed several memory models by
  examining the effects of levels of processing and the number of presentations
  on recognition memory receiver operating characteristics (ROCs). In general,
  when the ROCs were plotted in probability space they exhibited an inverted U
  shape; however, when they were plotted in z space they exhibited a U shape.
  An examination of the ROCs showed that the dual-process model could account
  for the observed ROCs, but that models based solely on either threshold or
  signal-detection processes failed to provide a sufficient account of the
  data. Furthermore, an examination of subjects’ introspective reports using
  the remember/know procedure showed that subjects were aware of recollection
  and familiarity and were able to consistently report on their occurrence. The
  remember/know data were used to accurately predict the shapes of the ROCs,
  and estimates of recollection and familiarity derived from the ROC data
  mirrored the subjective reports of these processes.%

    Most models of recognition memory rely on a strength/familiarity-based
  signal detection account that assumes that the processes giving rise to a
  confidence judgment are the same as those giving rise to an old-new decision.
  Confidence is assumed to be scaled directly from the perceived familiarity of
  a probe. This assumption was tested in 2 experiments that examine the shape
  of confidence-based z receiver operating characteristic (zROC) curves under
  different levels of response bias induced by changing stimulus probabilities
  (Experiment 1) and payoffs (Experiment 2). Changes in the shape of the zRQC
